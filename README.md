# GD Discord Leaderboard Maker

To get your Leaderboard add a `leaderboard.json` file (you have the `leaderboard_example.json`).
Replace the numbers in `<@456969486515894165>` by the ID of the Discord user (Discord -> User's page -> ... -> Copy user's ID)

You can change the final message in the end of `main.py`.

After that, you can execute `main.py`. The final message will appear in your console and in `result.txt`.

Positions are counted by the only good list: [https://demonlist.org/](Global Demonlist), thank to them for providing the API and the documentation for it.
